      Hello, I'm Mehmet Berk Camkıran. I was born and raised in Ankara, the
      capital city of Turkey, and completed all my education degrees here. I
      participated in various activities and seminars throughout my university
      life. I have a serious desire in the field of entrepreneurship. When I
      graduated from university, I started a brand in women's clothing, but I
      had financial problems because it coincided with the onset of the pandemic
      and the economic crisis. It may be a cliché, but every positive or
      negative event I have experienced in the business world is gold. Thanks to
      my ability to communicate with foreign customers, my employers have always
      been satisfied with my performance. I consider myself at a good level in
      video conferencing or physical meetings with foreign customers. I enjoy
      being a fixer. I want to point out that I am a competitive person.
      <b>
        I'm currently learning web development which is my dream from since I
        was a kid !</b
